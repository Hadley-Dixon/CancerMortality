# CancerMortality

Designed, validated, and tested a multivariate least squares regression model to predict cancer mortality rates of US counties. This project includes feature engineering, model selection, and validation using adjusted RÂ² and MSPE, providing a comprehensive analysis of demographic and healthcare factors influencing cancer mortality, along with the full code and methodology.

For a full breakdown of my project architecture and results, please refer to my final report (Cancer Mortality Rates for US Counties MLR Report.pdf).
